# FarmOS NWS
Automated importing of National Weather Service (NWS) data into FarmOS.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National
Weather Service to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log 
data from a trusted weather source.

Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS
installation going as temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not
have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the maintenance costs by 
reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.
