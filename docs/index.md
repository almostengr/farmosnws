# FarmOS NWS
A Drupal module to allow automated importing of National Weather Service (NWS) data into FarmOS.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National
Weather Service to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log 
data from a trusted weather source. 

Bit Second noticed that some small farmers and gardeners do not have the 
financial resources to deploy many sensors for their FarmOS installation. 
However, by combining the data provide from the local NWS weather station and
using additional Drupal modules, FarmOS can be better automated with a lower
investment.
